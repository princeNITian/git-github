git init // create local empty respository.

we call remote respository origin
git remote add origin <link>

Pull files with 'git pull'

Push your own changes into central repo with 'git push'


-> git pull origin master

// If git pull origin master throws fatal 'http' is not supported
then set link without quotes.
try git remote -v
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/princeNITian/git-github.git



// PULL 
git pull origin master

// PUSH
git push origin master

/*********************Making Changes*********************/

git status -> tells you which files are added to index and are ready to commit

git add -> Lets you add files to your index.

git commit -> It refers to recording snapshots of the repository at a given time.
Committed snapshots will never change unless done explicitly.

If we make a new file it is called untracked file.
We have to add it to index file.

git commit -m "Some message here" // It will commit to local repo

git add -A // all files will be added at once.

git commit -a -m "message" // all files will be committed at once.

//*****************PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT**************//
Branches are pointer to a specific commit.
Branches are of two types:
-> Local Branches
-> Remote-tracking Branches

Creating a Branch
git branch firstbranch
To switch a branch
git checkout firstbranch

//Merging
It is a way to combine the work od different branches together.
Allows to branch off, develop a new feature and combine it back in.
 
 whenever we merge the destination is always master
 ie. come to master branch then:
 git merge firstbranch

 //once a file is added to index we don't need to use add agian and agian so we can use directly commit.

 /// Rebasing -> this is also a way of combining the work between different branches.
 It can be used to make a linear sequence of commits.
